    "section": "",
    "text": "In an era of AI-enabled applications, chats, and programming (now with Devin), many youngsters and new entrants in the data science field assume that learning programming isn’t needed as almost all codes are available either on stack overflow or ChatGPT.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, programming is not just a copy-and-paste activity. But it is an iterative process of four pieces:\n\nWhat to Code?\nHow to Code?\nTest the Code?\nCoding with-in limitations.\n\nHere, What to Code can be comprehended as an Ideaation/Requirement Gathering and Planning stage. Ideas can be either intrinsic or extrinsic, but the primary reward goes to both, i.e., the idea and proper planning. This is itself an intensive area where the know-how of coding is required; otherwise, the entire planning and further execution would fall into a fallacy.\nHow to Code involves the Coding the requirement, unit-testing and documentation stage. Coding becomes an iterative step along with unit testing since our code changes should not hamper that part of the unit.\nTest the Code involves Reviewing the code and completing the system-testing stage. After we complete our code, it needs to be reviewed and refined by a senior programmer, ideally with an intention to optimize its performance and ensure that this particular fix will not hamper other units in the system.\nCoding within limitation involves the Deployment and Maintenance stage. After the entire coding, testing, and documentation are completed, Deployment becomes a central learning as initial programming doesn’t involve physical limitations. Deployment limitations, becomes an iterative process to enhance our coding.\nIf we understand this complete cycle of programming, we will learn that coding is not just a copy-paste job but often requires a thought process for maintenance of the code for long-term usage. However, there might be some applications ( we can term such applications as AI-assisted programming applications ) in the future that would help automate some of these. Still, it would require a keen human eye and thought process for thorough Deployment.\nIf you heard about Scrum masters or Scrum certification it is good else google it. These people are often valued because they are aware of the fundamentals of agile methodological practices, which involve iterative steps of planning, coding, testing, and maintenance.\n\nSome Future or Current Technologies\n\nCoding Assistant:\n\nCode Autocompletion ; Example: Github Copilot\nAI Driven Automation Testing; Example: Testim\n\nMinimal Coding:\n\nLow-Code Platform ; Example: Microsoft Power Apps\nNo-Code Platform; Example: Bubble, Google AppSheet\n\nPower Computing:\n\nServerless Computing ; Example: AWS Lambda\nEdge Computing; Example: AWS IoT\nQuantum Computing; Example: IBM Quantum\n\n\nView them as assistants that will fasten our process such that a particular idea’s “time to market” will come down exponentially."

    "section": "2. Simpler Thumb Rules",
    "text": "2. Simpler Thumb Rules\nThe more straightforward thumb rule is to print the classification report from sci-kit Learn and use one of these metrics for our classification modelling. This is an excellent place to start, as most of the ML problems we solve commercially fall into these four metrics.\n\n\n\nSource : https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html\n\n\nIn most classification problems, the target class would be either a positive or negative; under this content, let us review the intuition behind these metrics.\n\n2.1. Accuracy\nIn more straightforward English, it is how accurate you are. If there are 50 positive and 50 negative instances, accuracy measures how many times the model is able to predict accurately the right instances out of these 100 original instances.\nIf the model can correctly predict 30 positive and 50 negative instances, it means that the model’s accuracy is 80 correctly predicted instances out of the total 100 cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing this metric is always a problem as there is a high chance of giving more accuracy under imbalanced class scenarios.\nIf there are 5 positive instances and 95 negative instances and model-1 can predict 0 positive instances and 85 negative instances, we say that model-1 has 85% accuracy. While model-2 can predict four positive instances and 79 negative instances, we say that model-2 has 83% accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we look at the accuracy metric without having the context of our data, we may choose a poor model-1, which has higher accuracy.\n\n\n2.2. Recall:\nIn more straightforward English, recall is how much your model can recall the scenario. In a binary classification model, we usually refer to recall to the positive class to ensure that the model recalls the maximum positive instances. It calculates the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.\nReturning to our earlier example, which model is better off if there are 5 positive instances and 95 negative instances for model-1 and model-2?\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, if we want to be sure that the number of predicted positive instances upon actual positive instances should be more, we will select model-2 instead of model-1.\nNow, let’s go back to our first example again, which is that there are 50 positive instances and 50 negative instances, and model-1 is able to predict 15 positive instances and 50 negative instances. Here, model 1 has almost 65% accuracy and a recall of 30% for positive instances. Similarly, model 2 can predict 25 positive and 50 negative instances. Here, model 2 has almost 65% accuracy and a recall of 50% for positive cases.\nModel 2 is better when we look into recall metrics. Isn’t it so?\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, when completing the entire confusion matrix, it might look like this: do you see something off? What is the catch?\n\n\n\n\n\nModel-1 doesn’t have any false alarms, which means the model-1 is more precise in predicting positive instances.\n\n\n2.3. Precision:\nIn more straightforward English, precision is the degree to which the model is precise, like hitting a bull’s eye for positive instances. High precision signifies a low false positive rate. Mathemically it is like ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions made by the model.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder this scenario, model 1 is more precise.\n\n\n2.4. F1-Score:\nF1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balance between precision and recall, making it a useful metric when there’s an uneven class distribution. A high F1-Score indicates both high precision and high recall.\nUsually, while developing model we stick to one metric."

Why stick to one metric?\nOften, rather than sticking to one model, it is wise to prepare multiple models, optimize them using the development dataset, and use the test set for the final performance.

    "section": "4. How to Choose",
    "text": "4. How to Choose\nThis part of the blog is the prime Purpose, which depends upon the two questions that Data Scientists need to ask the business stakeholders i.e.; Purpose and usage. Purpose gives the revenue for the model, and usage tells us the cost.\nHow come?\nLet’s dwell on some examples.\n\n4.1. Example - Cross-Sell\nPurpose - Identify Customers who can buy Product1. Usage1 - Digital Campaigns ( Machine to Human ) Usage2 - Non-Digital Campaigns ( Human to Human )\nIf we look at the Purpose, we might think accuracy would be sufficient to predict whether a customer will buy a particular product. This is the usual de facto approach we think.\nNow, depending on usage, we need to optimize the metric, as it also tells us the cost of the usage.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage1 -&gt; Usually, digital campaigns are low-cost. We want to be sure to reach as many right customers as possible at a low cost. So, in this scenario, it is better to optimize the models using recall since we don’t want to miss the right customer.\nUsage2 -&gt; Usually, in non-digital campaigns, the cost is higher, and since the interaction is between humans, we have to ensure the trust chain of the model carries forward to the field team. So, in this scenario, it is better to optimize models using the precision metric.\n\n\n4.2. Example - Customer Attrition\nPurpose - Identify Customers who would stop transacting Usage1 - Carrot Communication in Digital way ( Machine to Human ) - Incentive Usage2 - Carrot Communication in Non-Digital way ( Human to Human ) - Incentive\nIf we look at the Purpose, we might think accuracy would be sufficient as we just want to predict whether a customer would at-rite. This is the usual de facto approach we would think.\nNow, depending on usage, let’s optimize the metric.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage1 -&gt; Although digital campaigns are low-cost here, we need to ensure we predict all customers who will at-rite and give-away fewer incentives to the customers who actually don’t at-rite. So, in this scenario, it is better to optimize the models using the F1-Score metric.\nUsage2 -&gt; Since trust-chain matters a lot in non-digital campaigns, apart from cost, it is better to optimize models using the precision metric.\n\n\n4.3. Example - Fraudulent Transaction\nPurpose - Identify Customers’ accounts of fraudulent activity. Usage1 - Digital Alarm ( Machine to Human ) Usage2 - Non-Digital Alarm ( Human to Human )\nIf we just look at the Purpose, we might think that by default, we will select the Precision metric to ensure that fraudulent activity is arrested.\nNow, depending on usage, let’s optimize the metric.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage1 -&gt; Since digital campaigns are low-cost here, we must ensure we predict all fraudulent activities with fewer false alarms. So, it is better to optimize the model with F1-Score.\nUsage2 -&gt; Since cost and trust-chain until customer matters a lot in non-digital campaigns, it is better to optimize models using the precision metric. However, in some scenarios F1-Score can be used if it is digitally assisted.\nSo, to summarize, we need to optimize the model based on the chosen metric of Purpose and usage, which is highly based on the context and business usage."

    "title": "Does Data Scientists need to understand Domain Knowledge?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This article intends to explain domain knowledge’s importance to freshers. The example provided below is from my own experience.\nBusinesses, by nature, want to earn profits, and why is it needed to make profits? From an employee perspective, the company gives salary and growth; from a company perspective, it intends to stay long, live and fresh as it grows.\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\nIf the business needs to stay longer, the profit has to be on the positive side. It means either the revenue should increase or the cost should decrease; also, both can happen.\nLet us explore simple business case scenarios that will help us learn why understanding the business comes first before we solutionize.\nCase { Retail Store Business }\nAssume that a data scientist was tasked to help the retail store stock the “right” quantity. By intuition, most “data scientists” consider the last X years of data for prediction. They may take various models from “simple averages” to “ARIMA” to “LSTM” and choose the best model based on the evaluation metrics like AIC or BIC, or MAPE. { Classic Time series modelling algorithms }\nAfter this exercise, we will determine the quantity that could sell for the next period. Does it end here?\nIt would not, because we haven’t answered the business question of what should be the stock holding for the next period. i.e., how many goods should be stocked in the store?\nSay, if we want to proceed with the model’s output itself. Since the model has inherent bias and variance, certain goods might get stocked out sooner, and others will not sell as predicted. { Alternatively, at times, the business could not procure the goods as indicated due to the cash flow constraint. Which we will discuss in other cases}\nWhat happens if there is stock out; revenue drops. Alternatively, what happens if there is excess stock; cost increases. In both of these cases, the profit decreases.\nShould we conclude that data science is not helping in this scenario? No, it isn’t.\nIt is just that it has not been adequately solutionized. So far, we have put the hat of “Machine Learning”, which needs to be started with the “Traditional Research” cap.\nUnder Traditional research, we may learn the following things: - Stock will come from warehouses every two days, for which the indent has to be shared a day earlier.\n\nIn all case scenarios, a buffer or safety stock should be kept in the store for fast-moving items to avoid supply chain shocks.\nEvading bull-whip effect, the probable forecast for certain goods must be shared with vendors for effective coordination.\nA simulation must be constructed such that the stock at the store is not too high to avoid high business costs. Also, the store needs to maintain sufficient service levels(of the goods, i.e., stock availability) so the customer doesn’t face a bad experience.\n\nBased on these learnings, we will research any existing methodologies available to address these questions. Bingo!!\nWe would crack the solution by browsing the topics of Supply Chain Analytics or Operations Optimization.\nWhich will provide methods to arrive at Safety Stock, Re-order Level, Re-order Quantity and Service Levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here, we can use ML ( Time Series Modelling ) to arrive at tomorrow’s prediction and perform a simulation ( Monte Carlo Simulation ) to arrive at service levels for different clusters ( K-Means Clustering ) of products. These outputs are fed into the above solution we saw in “Traditional Research”.\nLater we wear the “Software Development” hat to fine-tune the coding and keep the end-to-end pieces in hands-off mode.\nIn this way, Data Scientists must change hats to complete the work.\nIn this case, we can clearly see that the “Traditional Research” hat is hugely needed to understand the “lay of the land”. Else the entire modelling effort would have faced an identity crisis.\nIs there any defined prescription or rules to understand the lay of the land? The answer is NO. The long answer is\n\nCuriosity to learn about the domain.\nAsking the business the right questions.\nDoing personal research as, at times, business is driven by perceptions or experience. { Only a “fresh eye” brings a new perspective } - Learning what others have done already. There would have been plenty of research already available. { There is no need for new IP in most of the scenarios }\nLearning Consultant frameworks like BCG Matrix, Product Life Cycle, Customer Life Cycle, etc., will help us think on alternative perspectives.\n\nThere are several examples that I have faced personally in my early data science career, which told me the hard way about the importance of domain knowledge. The above example is one such classic. Stay tuned for more Data science news."
