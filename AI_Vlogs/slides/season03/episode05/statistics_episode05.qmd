# Episode 05 - Probability Fundamentals

Today, we unravel the basics of probability.

## What is Probability?

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
**Probability** measures *how likely* an event is to happen.

Values between **0** (impossible) and **1** (certain).

Expressed often as fractions, decimals, or percentages.

> *Intuition:* If you toss a fair coin, probability of Heads = 0.5.

## Key Terms

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
| Term                 | Meaning                               |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Sample Space (S)** | Set of all possible outcomes          |
| **Event (E)**        | A subset of the sample space          |
| **Outcome**          | A single result from the sample space |

### Probability of an Event

P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes

*Example:* Probability of getting Heads when tossing a coin:

P(Heads) = 1/2 = 0.5
:::

## Probability Rules — The Basics

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
**Rule 1:** 0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1

**Rule 2:** P(S) = 1 (Probability of entire sample space is 1)

**Rule 3:** P(E\^c) = 1 - P(E) (Complement rule)
:::

## Complement Rule Example

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
If probability of rain tomorrow is 0.3, then probability of no rain is:

P(No Rain) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
:::

## Addition Rule for Mutually Exclusive Events

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)

*Example:* Probability of rolling a 1 or 2 on a die:

P(1 or 2) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3
:::

## Conditional Probability Introduction

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
Probability of event A *given* event B has occurred: P(A\|B)

Formula:

P(A\|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

### Conditional Probability Example

If a card is red, probability it is a heart:

P(Heart) = 13/52

P(Red) = 26/52

So,

P(Heart \| Red) = P(Heart ∩ Red) / P(Red) = (13/52) / (26/52) = 1/2
