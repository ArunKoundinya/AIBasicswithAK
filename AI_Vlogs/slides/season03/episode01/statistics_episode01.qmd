## What is Statistics?

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
Statistics is the **science of learning from data**.

-   It helps us make **sense** of numbers.
-   It reveals **patterns** hidden in the chaos.
-   It supports **better decisions** in uncertain conditions.

🧠 Think of it as: \> “A flashlight in the dark cave of data.”

## Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}
### Descriptive

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Summarizes what we *already know*
-   Mean, median, mode, standard deviation
-   Charts, graphs

🧊 Like describing the ice cube you’re holding.

### Inferential

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Makes predictions from *samples*
-   Confidence intervals, hypothesis tests

🔮 Like guessing how cold the whole freezer is from just a few cubes.

## Why AI Needs Statistics

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Models learn from **data patterns**
-   Evaluation depends on **accuracy, error, variation**
-   Sampling & generalization are core to **ML algorithms**

📌 No statistics → No insight.

## Real-Life Examples

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Health: What’s the average heart rate for a 30-year-old?
-   Education: Do students who sleep more perform better?
-   Sports: How consistent is a cricketer’s performance?

💡 In every case, we need: 1. **Data** 2. **Understanding** 3. **Decision**
:::

## Use Case: Business Decisions

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Understanding customer trends
-   Improving marketing with A/B testing
-   Forecasting inventory needs

📈 Businesses thrive on informed decisions.
:::

## Use Case: Government Planning

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Planning hospitals and schools using census data
-   Tracking population and regional needs
-   Allocating resources effectively

🧮 Policies backed by real numbers.

## Visual Demo

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
| Student | Sleep Hours | Exam Score |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| A       | 6           | 72         |
| B       | 8           | 85         |
| C       | 5           | 65         |
| D       | 7           | 78         |
| E       | 4           | 60         |

🧠 What patterns do you notice?

-   Is more sleep associated with better scores?
-   What’s the average score?
:::

## Key Takeaways

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Statistics helps us **understand** and **predict**.
-   Descriptive = summarize; Inferential = generalize.
-   AI is built on statistical reasoning.
-   You're already using stats in everyday life!
