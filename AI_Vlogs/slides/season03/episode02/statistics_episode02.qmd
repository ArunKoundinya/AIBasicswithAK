## What Are Data Types?

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
Data is the **raw material** for statistics and AI.

-   Different types of data require different tools.
-   Understanding data types helps us **choose the right methods**.
-   Think of data types as the **language of information**. ðŸ§  *Imagine data types as different kinds of ingredients in a kitchen.*
:::

## Categorical vs Numerical Data

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
### Categorical Data

-   Represents **categories or groups**.
-   Examples: Colors (Red, Blue), Types of fruit, Yes/No answers.
-   Can be **nominal** (no order) or **ordinal** (with order). *Like sorting fruits by color or type.*

### Numerical Data

-   Represents **quantities or measurements**.
-   Examples: Height, Age, Temperature, Scores.
-   Can be **discrete** (countable, e.g., number of apples) or **continuous** (any value, e.g., weight). *Like measuring the length of a table.*
:::

## Structured vs Unstructured Data

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
### Structured Data

-   Organized in rows and columns.
-   Easy to store and analyze.
-   Examples: Excel spreadsheets, databases. *Like a neatly arranged filing cabinet.*

### Unstructured Data

-   Not organized in a predefined way.
-   Harder to analyze directly.
-   Examples: Images, text, videos, audio. *Like a messy desk with papers everywhere.*
:::

## Why Data Type Matters in Analysis

-   Determines **which statistical methods** apply.
-   Impacts **data visualization choices**.
-   Influences **machine learning algorithms**. ðŸ“Œ *Choosing the wrong approach can lead to **wrong conclusions***.

## Real-Life Examples

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
| Data Type    | Example                       | Use in AI/Stats              |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Categorical  | Customer Gender (Male/Female) | Grouping, classification     |
| Numerical    | Daily Temperature (Â°C)        | Trend analysis, forecasting  |
| Structured   | Sales Data in Excel           | Easy querying and statistics |
| Unstructured | Customer Reviews (Text)       | Sentiment analysis, NLP      |
:::

## Identifying Data Types

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
ðŸ§  *Try classifying items around you by these types!*

| Feature           | Sample Values                 | Data Type    |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| Favorite Color    | Red, Blue, Green              | Categorical  |
| Age               | 25, 30, 22, 28                | Numerical    |
| Customer Feedback | "Great service", "Too slow"   | Unstructured |
| Sales Records     | Rows of date, amount, product | Structured   |
:::

## Key Takeaways

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   Data types are the **building blocks** of analysis.
-   Categorical vs Numerical: groups vs quantities.
-   Structured data is organized; unstructured is raw and complex.
-   Knowing your data type helps you **make smarter decisions**. \## âœ¨ Coming Up Next
