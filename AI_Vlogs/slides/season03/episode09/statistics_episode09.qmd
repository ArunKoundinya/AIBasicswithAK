# Episode 09 - T-Distribution and t-tests


## Recap: Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}

For large sample sizes, the sampling distribution of the sample mean $\bar{X}$ is approximately normal:

$$
\bar{X} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)
$$

When the population standard deviation $\sigma$ is known, the normal (Z) distribution guides inference.

But what if $\sigma$ is unknown and the sample size is small?

:::

## Transition: From Normal to t-distribution

::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}

In practice, $\sigma$ is rarely known.

Instead, we estimate it using the sample standard deviation $s$.

When $\sigma$ is replaced by $s$, the standardized statistic becomes:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}
$$

Unlike the Z-statistic, this quantity no longer follows the standard normal distribution.

Instead, it follows a **t-distribution** with

$$
df = n - 1
$$

degrees of freedom.

The loss of one degree of freedom reflects the estimation of the sample mean in computing $s$.

### Reflect

::: {style="font-size: 30%;"}

Why do we lose one degree of freedom?

Hint:
When computing $s$, how many values are free to vary once $\bar{X}$ is fixed?

:::

## The t-Distribution

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}

The t-distribution is symmetric and centered at 0, much like the normal distribution.

However, because $s$ varies from sample to sample, the resulting statistic has **greater variability**.

This produces heavier tails compared to the normal distribution.

The shape depends on the degrees of freedom:

- Smaller $df$ → heavier tails  
- Larger $df$ → closer to normal  

As $df \to \infty$, the t-distribution converges to the standard normal distribution.

:::

## Visualizing the t-distribution

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}

To see this behavior clearly, we compare:

- The standard normal distribution  
- A t-distribution with $df = 5$  
- A t-distribution with $df = 20$

Observe how smaller degrees of freedom produce thicker tails, reflecting increased uncertainty when estimating $\sigma$ from small samples.

### Prediction Time

Before we look at the plot:

- Which curve will have the heaviest tails?
- What happens as $df$ increases?
- At what point do you think it becomes indistinguishable from normal?


:::

## Visualizing the t-distribution

Notice how the t-distributions with lower df have broader, heavier tails.

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import t, norm

x = np.linspace(-4, 4, 200)
plt.plot(x, norm.pdf(x), 'k--', label='Normal (Z)')
plt.plot(x, t.pdf(x, df=5), label='t-distribution (df=5)')
plt.plot(x, t.pdf(x, df=20), label='t-distribution (df=20)')
plt.title("Comparison of t-distributions with Normal distribution")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## What Do You Notice?

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}


- How does $df = 5$ compare with the normal curve?
- Is $df = 20$ already close?
- Why does larger $n$ reduce uncertainty?


### Decision Rule Check

If:

- $n = 12$ and $\sigma$ unknown → ?
- $n = 100$ and $\sigma$ unknown → ?
- $\sigma$ known → ?

Which distribution should guide inference?

:::

## Summing Up

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}


When $\sigma$ is known → use the Z-statistic.

When $\sigma$ is unknown and the sample size is small → use the t-statistic:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}}
$$

The t-distribution adjusts for additional uncertainty introduced by estimating $\sigma$.

As sample size increases, this adjustment becomes negligible — and the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution.
